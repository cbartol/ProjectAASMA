<h1 style="text-align: center">Tutorial 1</h1>
<p>This tutorial learn you how to move your NanoAI. For testing purpose, select 
the lesson called 1-Injection Point and first actions.</p>
<p>Click on the New Strategy button. This will create an empty strategy with 
nothing in it.</p>
<p>Your first task is to add a nanoAI: click on the New NanoAI in the New 
Nanobot toolbar.</p>
<p>If you click on the Build button, you&#39;ll see there is two errors: your 
Strategy doesn&#39;t have a valid name (its empty) and no default state is define 
for your NanoAI. Don&#39;t worry, we will correct this.</p>
<h2>Strategy Name and Injection Point</h2>
<p>Select the first node in the Strategy Treeview, the Strategy node. Write a 
name for your Strategy. Because it will be the name of the file, you must enter 
valid characters for it (for example &quot;\&quot; is not allowed). Click on Apply button 
and Save your Strategy: you see it now in your Strategy files Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must then define your injection point. You know that in this mission, you 
have one objective, a Navigation Objective. So we will decide to be injected at 
the middle of the Navigation Objective Points.</p>
<p>To do so, set the weight of Objective Points to 100 and the others to 0 and 
choose to keep the calculated location. In this mission, there is only 2 
navigation objectives, so your NanoAI will be injected just at the middle of 
those 2 points (inside the stream).</p>
<p>To go faster, you can also choose to be injected at the nearest Navigation 
Objective Point from this middle: you will be injected directly on one Objective 
Point.</p>
<h2>Move your NanoAI</h2>
<p>In the Strategy Treeview, expand the NanoAI node. You can see there is a 
state called DefaultState: each time you add a Nanobot, a state is added 
automaticly.</p>
<p>Once your NanoAI will be injected in the tissue, you want it to move to a 
Navigation Objective. So select the DefaultState node and click on the Add new 
MoveTo action.</p>
<p>Select your MoveTo node. You must define where you want it to go. In 
Destination, click on the arrow: you&#39;ll see the different possible locations. 
Those are grouped in categories.</p>
<p>In <strong>General</strong>, you can choose:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Current Location: it&#39;s the current location of your Nanobot (not usefull 
	for a MoveTo because your NanoAI will not move),</li>
	<li>X-Y: you can define a specific location on the tissue,</li>
	<li>Random: it&#39;s a random point at a certain distance from the current 
	location of the Nanobot. Can be usefull to scout around a point,</li>
	<li>Injection Point: it&#39;s the Injection Point of your team.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>MyBots</strong>, your Strategy will calculate this point depending 
of the type of a Nanobot:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Location: calculate the nearest location of a bot of a define type in my 
	team,</li>
	<li>Destination: calculate the nearest destination of a bot of a define type 
	in my team,</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example: imagine that you have define two Nanobot kind in your 
strategy, a NanoAI and a NanoExplorer1. Imagine next that you build 10 
NanoExplorer1. If you choose nearest Location of a NanoExplorer1 for the 
destination of your MoveTo action for your NanoAI, this NanoAI will go to the 
nearest location of a NanoExplorer1 in the tissue.</p>
<p>In <strong>Tissue.Points</strong>, you can choose:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The nearest Hoshimi Point from your location,</li>
	<li>The nearest AZN Point from your location,</li>
	<li>The nearest Navigation Objective Point from your location</li>
	<li>The nearest Navigation Objective Point not reached from your location.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>HoshimiNeedle.Points</strong>, you&#39;ll find locations of Hoshimi 
Points with or not with NanoNeedle of your team on it. There is also the Hoshimi 
Points with NanoNeedles not full of AZN molecules. We will see tutorial 3 how 
this can be usefull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <strong>Pierre.Bots</strong> and <strong>OtherPlayer.Bots</strong>, it&#39;s 
the same than with MyBots: you search the nearest location or destination of a 
Nanobot of a define type in Pierre team or in the Other player team. Beware: 
calculation os done with Nanobots that your Nanobots can see, ie in the scan 
range of your Nanobots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least, there is the <strong>Event</strong> category: this is usefull only 
when your are in a State that listen to an event. For example, the Event 
Location point in a Enemy Detected event is the location of the Pierre&#39;s Nanobot 
that have been detected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here, we will choose in Tissue.Points, the nearest Navigation Objective 
not reached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you test your Strategy, you&#39;ll see that everything will works fine, but we 
can add more informations: this can be usefully for complex strategy.</p>
<h2>Action details</h2>
<p>Select your MoveTo Action and check &quot;Change Internal Name&quot;. In the text area, 
write somthing like &quot;Go Obj&quot; and in &quot;Log text&quot; write &quot;Look for Objective Point&quot;.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll see in the 2D viewer that aside your NanoAI, &quot;Go Obj&quot; appear and &quot;Look 
for Objective Point&quot; appear in the log area. Trust me: for complex Strategy, it 
is very, very usefull.</p>
