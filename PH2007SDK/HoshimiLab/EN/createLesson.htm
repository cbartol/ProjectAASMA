How do I create a lesson or a complex mission?</h1>
<p>Creating a lesson, or a complex mission is quite easy. Both have the save 
file format which is in reality a zip file with the .phl extension. It contains 
the following files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The tissue, a .tsu file,</li>
	<li>The mission description, a .brief file with the same name than the .tsu 
	file,</li>
	<li>The help file, a .htm (only .htm) file,</li>
	<li>All pictures, css, etc. files needed by the Help file,</li>
	<li>a info file which contains description of the lesson (this is created by 
	the PHLessonCreator application),</li>
	<li>optionally a .zip file which can contains for example a solution, a 
	project,</li>
	<li>Optionally a .dll file which is Pierre AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you want to create a lesson or a complex mission, you must put all 
those files in the same directory.</p>
<p>There can be only one tsu, one brief, one htm and one zip files.</p>
<p>You can avoid providing the dll for Pierre AI and zip file.</p>
<p><strong>Create the phl file</strong></p>
<p>To help you creating the lesson, I provide you a small application called 
PHLessonCreator. Launch this application.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img alt="PHLessonCreator" src="../img/HoshimiLessonCreator.png" width="469" height="434" /></p>
<p>Click on the Browse Lesson and select your folder where you put all the 
files. If you forgot to put a needed file, it will tell you.</p>
<p>It will automaticly create the info file for you if it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>It will read the info file if it exist.</p>
<p>Then, fill the Lesson Informations part:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Name is the name of your lesson,</li>
	<li>Level can be 1, 2, 3 or special. If you want to create a complex mission 
	that will appear in the Developpers section, choose Special. If you want to 
	create a lesson for Beginners, select 1, 2 or 3.</li>
	<li>Author is your name.</li>
	<li>Country is the LCID of your country. For example 1033 for USA, 1036 for 
	France.</li>
	<li>School is your school or enterprise name.</li>
	<li>Mode can be Beginner only actually.</li>
	<li>ID is a unique Guid for your lesson. When you import a lesson, the 
	application read this Guid to see if it is already imported (an update it) 
	or not.</li>
	<li>Date of creation is when you created your lesson.</li>
	<li>Summary is the text that describe your lesson.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then edit your Tissue/Mission and your Htm file by using the Tools 
section. Use Config buttons to select applications that can edit your 
Tissue/Mission files and htm file.</p>
<p>Once your OK, click on the Package lesson to create the .phl file.</p>
<p><strong>Using the phl file in Project Hoshimi</strong></p>
<p>If you create a lesson for Beginners (with level 1, 2 or 3) or a complex 
Mission for Developpers, you need to 
import it. Launch Project Hoshimi application and go to the Beginner section.</p>
<p>On the top right, you&#39;ll see a Import Lessons button. Click on it and select 
the folder where is your .phl file. It will import all lessons files of this 
folder (for technical reasons, it must end the application and restart it).</p>
<p>Launch Project Hoshimi application and you&#39;ll see it in the Developpers 
sections and in the Special sections for Beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for Pierre team AI</strong></p>
<p>Pierre team AI is a player dll. So you have to create a new dll for it. This 
can be complex but hopefully, you can use Project Hoshimi for Beginners for it, 
it is fully compatible. So creating its AI can be done in feww seconds.</p>
<p>Launch Project Hoshimi and go to Beginner section. Select a lesson and create 
the strategy you want for Pierre. Some tips:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose an Injection Point near the center of the tissue,</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t make it too aggressive,</li>
</ul>
<p>Once it&#39;s done, Export your strategy.</p>
<p>Now, go back to the folder which contains all files of your lesson. Copy in 
it PHB1.dll in it and copy the strategy file you just created (it is in the 
%Project Hoshimi%/Beginners folder. Rename it pierre.phb.</p>
<p>This file is an Xml files. If you want that Pierre inject NeuroControllers at 
the beginning of the game, you must edit this Xml file. For example, if you want 
a NeuroController at (120,120) point at the beginning, edit the Xml file 
(pierre.phb file) and modify the &lt;neuros /&gt; node like this:</p>
<p>&lt;neuros&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;neuro x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;120&quot; /&gt;<br />
&lt;/neuros&gt;</p>
<p>Package again your lesson, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me on the discussion forum.</p>
