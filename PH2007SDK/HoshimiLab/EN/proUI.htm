<h2>Standard and&nbsp; new Nanobots toolbars</h2>
<p><img alt="Main functions" src="../img/pro3.jpg" width="397" height="27" /></p>
<p>The first button is the Build button. Click on it to see if there is no error 
in your strategy. If it contains errors, it will appear oin the Error list window (see below).</p>
<p>The arrow allow you to re-order Single Actions only.</p>
<p>Copy, cut, paste and delete button allow you to Copy, cut, paste and delete the selected node in 
the Strategy TreeView.</p>
<p>Next, each button allow you to add a new kind of Nanobot in your Strategy. 
You can have several kinds of each Nanobot but one (and only one) NanoAI and one 
or zero NanoIPCreator.</p>

		<br />
		<strong>Single Actions:</strong><br />
		Those are the different actions your Nanobots can do. It can MoveTo,

<h2>Error list window</h2>
<p>
<img alt="Errors list window" src="../img/pro8.jpg" width="486" height="62" /></p>
<p>If there is an error in your Strategy, this error appear in this window. To 
go directly to this error, double click on it.</p>
<h2>Details panel</h2>
<p>In this part, you can edit the selected node.</p>
<h3>Strategy Node</h3>
<p>If you select the first node of your strategy, you can define the name of 
your Strategy and the Injection Point wanted.</p>
<p><img alt="Strategy Node" src="../img/pro6.jpg" width="489" height="341" /></p>
<p>The name of your strategy is the name of your file. Change it and click on 
Apply button. Then save it and it will appear in the Strategy files manager.</p>
<p>You can choose your Injection Point in two way:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You define a specific location. Your NanoAI will be injected at the 
	nearest valid point in the tissue. For example if you select point (120, 
	120) and if this point is a bone area, your Injection Point will be the 
	nearest point not in a bone area.</li>
	<li>You define a Calculated location. At the beginning of the game, your 
	Strategy will calculte the middle of the Hoshimi Points available in the 
	tissue. It does the same with the AZN Points and the navigation objectives 
	points. Then, it calculate a point depending of the weight of each of those 
	points:<br />
	<br />
	Point = (HoshimiPoint middle * HP weight + AZN Points * AZNP weight + 
	Objectives Points * OBJP weight) /(HP weight + AZNP weight + OBJP weight)<br />
	<br />
	Then, you can choose to be injected at the nearest Hoshimi Point, AZN Point 
	or Objective Point of the calculated point or keep this calculated point.<br />
	Again, your Strategy will choose the nearest valid point in the tissue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you define your name and your Injection Point, click on Apply button.</p>
<h3>Nanobot Node</h3>
<p><img alt="Nanobot Node" src="../img/pro9.jpg" width="484" height="342" /></p>
<p>When you select a Nanobot node, you can change its kind of Nanobot and its 
Default State. When your nanobot is created in the tissue, its first actions are 
the actions in its Default State.</p>
<h3>State Node</h3>
<p><img alt="State Node" src="../img/pro10.jpg" width="486" height="235" /></p>
<p>When you select a State node, you can set its name. You can also define it as 
the default state (you can verify this by selecting then the Nanobot node).</p>
<p>A State contains Group, Test and Single Actions. When all the actions are 
executed, you can decide to repeat actions from the begining by selecting 
Forever radio button. If you want that all your actions are repeated a number of 
times, define it.</p>
<p>A Nanobot can also change its state by listening to events. For each Nanobot 
of your Strategy, there is 3 events:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nanobot destroyed,</li>
	<li>Enemy Detected,</li>
	<li>Other Player Detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want that your Nanobot execute some actions when one of those events 
is fired, check it and select it.</p>
<h3>Group Actions Node</h3>
<p><img alt="Group Actions" src="../img/pro11.jpg" width="486" height="185" /></p>
<p>A Group Actions can contains Group, Test and Single Actions. You can set its 
name and define if actions are repeated when all are done. For example if you 
want to build 4 NanoExplorer, add a Group Actions, add a Build action in it and 
set its repeat to 4. A Group Actions must contains one or more actions. It can&#39;t 
be empty.</p>
<h3>Test Actions</h3>
<p><img alt="Test Actions" src="../img/pro12.jpg" width="486" height="233" /></p>
<p>This is the more complicated ;-). A Test action contains two Group Action and 
a test. At the execution of a Test action, the test is...tested. If the result 
is true, the first Group Actions is executed, if not, the second is executed.</p>
<p>There is two kind of test:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Value test allow you to compare two values. For example, you can test if 
	the Number of NanoExplorer1 equal 0. If true, you can add a Build action.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Value Test" src="../img/pro13.jpg" width="324" height="210" />
<br />
<ul>
	<li>Distance Test allow you to compare the distance between 2 points. Fo 
	example here, I test if I&#39;m near a Pierre&#39;s Nanobot of any kind (distance &lt;= 
	10).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Distance Test" src="../img/pro14.jpg" width="486" height="97" /></p>
<p>You can define complex test. If you check the Show test in Log, result of the 
test will appear in the log area in the 2D viewer. This can be usefull in &quot;debug 
mode&quot;.</p>
<h3>Single Actions</h3>
<p>For each kind of actions, you can define parameters. For example, for a 
MoveTo action:</p>
<p><img alt="MoveTo Action" src="../img/pro15.jpg" width="486" height="276" /></p>
<p>You define where you want to go. Here, I choose the nearest Hoshimi Point 
with no NanoNeedle of my team.</p>
<p>In MoveTo, you can also define the distance from the destination you want to 
go. It can be usefull for example if you choose to attack a Pierres&#39;s Nanobot: 
select the Nearest Pierre&#39;s Nanobot points and a distance of 10 cells. You can 
stay away from it an attack it safely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each Single action, you can define more details:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Change Internal Name allow you to change its name in the viewer,</li>
	<li>Change State allow you to ... change its state. So next action to be 
	executed will be the first action of the selected State,</li>
	<li>Log text allow you to write in the log area in the 2D viewer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each kond of action you have different parameters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For CollectFrom, TransferTo and DefendTo, you define the location to 
	collect/transfer/defend, the number of turns you collect/transfer/defend and 
	the distance from the location,</li>
	<li>For Build, you must define which kind of Nanobot your NanoAI must build. 
	If you have a NanoIPCreator in your tissue, you can also ask that it appear 
	at the NanoIPCreator location,</li>
	<li>ForceAutoDestruction, OpenIP and CloseIP don&#39;t have parameters,</li>
	<li>StopMoving can be usefull to change State or to avoid going directly to 
	a Pierre&#39;s Nanobot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test your Strategy</h2>
<p>Once your strategy is ready, click on the Build button to be sure there is no 
error. Then, select your Mission, a Pierre&#39;s AI if you want and click on the 
Test Strategy button.</p>
