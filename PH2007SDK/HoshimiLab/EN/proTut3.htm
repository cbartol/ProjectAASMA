<h1 style="text-align: center">Tutorial 3</h1>
<p>This tutorial learn you how to Collect and Transfer AZN molecults in 
NanoNeedles. For testing purpose, select the lesson called 3-Collect</p>
<p>This mission is quite simple: you must reach a score of 500 points before 
turn 1000. You need to create NanoNeedle and to fill it with AZN molecules.</p>
<p>Create a new Strategy, choose an Injection Point and add:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a NanoAI,</li>
	<li>A NanoNeedle (will be called NanoNeedle1),</li>
	<li>A NanoContainer (will be called NanoContainer1),</li>
</ul>
<p>NanoContainer are better here than NanoCollector because we only want to 
collect AZN molecules.</p>
<h2>Building NanoNeedle and NanoContainer</h2>
<p>We need to build NanoNeedle on Hoshimi Point. In our strategy, we decide that 
for each NanoNeedle created, we will create two NanoContainer. It&#39;s because a 
NanoContainer can store 50 AZN molecules and that a NanoNeedle can store 100 AZN 
molecules.</p>
<p>So we will add the following actions to our NanoAI:</p>
<ol>
	<li>MoveTo nearest Hoshimi Point without Needle,</li>
	<li>Build a NanoNeedle1,</li>
	<li>Build a NanoContainer1,</li>
	<li>Build another NanoContainer1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing so, our NanoAI will create a NanoNeedle on each Hoshimi Points of the 
tissue.</p>
<h2>Configure NanoNeedle1 Actions</h2>
<p>Select then the NanoNeedle1. We need to add at least one action to it. We can 
decide to add for example a StopMoving (but not really interesting). We will add 
a DefendTo action. If a Pierre&#39;s Nanobot approach it, it will fire on it. In the 
parameters of your DefendTo action, set the destination to the Nearest Pierre&#39;s 
Nanobot location.</p>
<h2>Configure NanoContainer1 Actions</h2>
<p>One simple solution for our NanoContainer1 would be in its DefaultState to 
add the following actions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>MoveTo nearest AZN Point,</li>
	<li>CollectFrom Current Location during 10 turns,</li>
	<li>MoveTo nearest Hoshimi Point with Not Full Needle,</li>
	<li>TransferTo Current Location during 10 turns.</li>
</ol>
<p>It works, quite well. But we will improve it. To understand the following, 
test first the strategy and look carefully.</p>
<p>What happen? Sometimes, a NanoContainer1 can reach a NanoNeedle1 which is 
already full. Why? Because while the NanoContainer1 was moving to the 
NanoNeedle1, another NanoContainer1 fill the NanoNeedle1. And worse, once our 
NanoContainer1 reached the NanoNeedle1, it go back to the AZN Point to get some 
molecules but with a full stock: it loose a lot of time!</p>
<p>To improve this, we will need to add a Test Action.</p>
<p>Delete all the actions inside the NanoContainer1 Default State and add a Test 
Action. Configure the test to: If Nanobot Stock &gt; 0?</p>
<p>In the True result (repeat = 1), add:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MoveTo Hoshimi Point With Not Full Needle,</li>
	<li>TransferTo Current Location during 10 turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the False result (repeat = 1), add:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MoveTo AZN Point,</li>
	<li>CollectFrom Current Location during 10 turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s it, and it is really better: at start, because its stock equal 0, it 
goes to the AZN Point and fill its stock. Then, it goes to the NanoNeedle not 
full. When reaching the Needle, after trying to TransferTo it all its AZN, test 
is run again. If its empty, it goes back to the AZN Point. If not, it tries to 
find another not full NanoNeedle.</p>
<p>You can even improve the strategy of your NanoContainer by moving in two step 
to the NanoNeedle1. True Result must in this case contains the following 
actions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MoveTo Hoshimi Point With Not Full Needle but Distance from Destination 
	= 10,</li>
	<li>MoveTo Hoshimi Point With Not Full Needle (Distance from Destination = 
	0),</li>
	<li>TransferTo Current Location during 10 turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here, it don&#39;t go directly to the NanoNeedle location. It stop first 10 
cells away from it. Then, by using again the MoveTo, it recalcultate the nearest 
not full needle.</p>
<p>Do some test to see the differences.</p>
