<h1>Lesson 4</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>You can meet a bad boy in the tissue: Pierre team. Pierre can build 
NeuroController (Nanobots that can&#39;t move but can fire against your Nanobots) 
and Protectors.</p>
<p>In this mission, you have only one objective: there must be no 
NeuroControllers in the tissue at turn 1400. So you will have to destroy all of 
them.</p>
<h2>Pierre's team:</h2>
<p>Select first an Injection Point and launch a game. You see that at the 
beginning of the game, Pierre have already 6 NeuroControllers on the tissue. 
Those NeuroControllers will always appear at the same locations.</p>
<p>For example, there is one at (133, 133).</p>
<h2>Squads:</h2>
<p>Create a Protector Squad and check the Attack Enemy option.</p>
<h2>Actions:</h2>
<p>Go back to Action tab and ask your Protector Sqaud to go to these location.</p>
<p>As it is near the NeuroController, you&#39;ll see that they are under attack but 
don&#39;t do anything, still trying to move to (133, 133) point. The bad news is 
that they are destroyed before reaching this point. Why it didn&#39;t attack the 
NeuroController? This is because it didn&#39;t finish its action (MoveTo).</p>
<h2>Scan characteristic:</h2>
<p>Each Nanobot have a Scan characteristic. When the distance between the 
Protector and the NeuroController is lower than this value, your Protector can 
see it.</p>
<h2>DefenseDistance characteristic:</h2>
<p>Each Nanobot have also a DefenseDistance characteristic. It can&#39;t fire a 
point which is greater than this distance.</p>
<h2>Your goal:</h2>
<p>So your goal, is to be near the NeuroController to see it and be able to 
attack it, but not to near that it can fire you.</p>
<p>Make some try and destroy all those bad NeuroControllers.</p>
