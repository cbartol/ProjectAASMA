<h1>Lesson 3</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this lesson, you will learn how to create NanoNeedle, collect AZN 
molecules and transfer those molecules in your NanoNeedle.</p>
<h2>NanoNeedles:</h2>
<p>To build a NanoNeedle, you use the <b>BuildNeedle</b> action of your NanoAI. The NanoNeedle will be built <u>where your NanoAI is</u>.</p>
<p>So to build a NanoNeedle on a Hoshimi Point, you&#39;ll have first to 
Move your NanoAI to the Hoshimi Point and then build the NanoNeedle.</p>
<p>(<i>It is important to gain points to build your NanoNedle on Hoshimi Points</i>).</p>
<h2>Injection Point:</h2>
<p>So first, choose an Injection Point near a Hoshimi Point. For example , 
choose here <b>(150, 50)</b>.</p>
<h2>Build the NanoNeedle:</h2>
<p><u>Add two actions to your NanoAI:</u></p>
<ul>
	<li>MoveTo (143 54) where is the Hoshimi Point,</li>
	<li>BuildNeedle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test your strategy and you will see your first NanoNeedle.</p>
<h2>Collecting AZN Molecules:</h2>
<p>Collectors (and Containers) allow you to extract AZN Molecules from AZN 
Points.</p>
<p>A collector can stock 20 molecules and can extract (and transfer) 5 molecules/turn.</p>
<p>A container can stock 50 molecules and can extract (and transfer) 5 molecules/turn.</p>
<p>So to collect AZN, containers seems better, but a container can&#39;t defend 
itself against enemy.</p>
<p>Create a new squad of collector with 1 collector only.</p>
<p>Go back to the Action tab and add it the following actions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MoveTo AZN point at (154, 54)</li>
	<li>Collect AZN molecules at (154, 54) with the option &quot;Number of turn = 4&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>So your NanoCollector will be injected at the Injection Point, will move to 
the AZN point and then collect 4 turns*5 = 20 molecules.</p>
<p>At the same time, your NanoAI will build the NanoNeedle at the Hoshimi Point.</p>
<h2>Transfer the molecules to the NanoNeedle:</h2>
<p>To gain points, you must transfer the molecules in the NanoNeedle. You will 
ask your NanoCollector to do so. Add to it the following actions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MoveTo the NanoNeedle (143, 54),</li>
	<li>TransferTo at (143, 54) during 4 turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test your strategy: you&#39;ll see your NanoCollector collecting and transfering 
AZN molecules to the NanoNeedle. It will go back 5 times to the AZN Point 
because the NanoNeedle can stock up to 100 molecules. So it take quite a long 
time to fill the NanoNeedle.</p>
<p>You can see too that your NanoCollector will not move anymore when the 
NanoNeedle will be filled, because it is trying to trasfer its molecules but 
can&#39;t do that.</p>
<p>To go faster, increase the number of Collectors in your squad in the Squad 
tab. You can fill the NanoNeedle in one time only.</p>
<h2>Score objective</h2>
<p>There is only one objective in this mission, it is a score objective: you 
must reach 700 points before turn 700. So you&#39;ll have to create more NanoNeedles, 
and more squads.</p>
<p>Then, try to reach the highest score the quickless you can.</p>
